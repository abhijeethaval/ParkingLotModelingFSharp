# ParkingLotModelingFSharp

This is F# implementation of Car Parking domain modeling. It is inspired from the book "Domain Modeling Made Functional" by Scott Wlaschin and "Types + Properties = Software" blog series by Mark Seemann.

F# is functional first multi paradigm proggramming language with following features:
1. Static typing
2. Algebraic type system 
3. Strong type inference 

These features alongwith support on mainstream programming platform (.NET Framework and .NET Core) and visual studio tooling makes F# ideal for domain modeling for any simple to complex domain.
